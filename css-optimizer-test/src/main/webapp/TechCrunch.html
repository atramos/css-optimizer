arrive at the<a href=\"http:\/\/skydeck.berkeley.edu\/\"> SkyDeck headquarters<\/a>. The floors of U.C. Berkeley\u2019s accelerator are lined with the things, with the startup\u2019s small team frantically working to get them up and running in corner of the space.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The robots have become a familiar sight to anyone who\u2019s spent any time on the U.C. Berkeley campus recently. Unlike countless hardware startups, who spend years incubating and iterating products, Kiwi\u2019s team couldn\u2019t wait to take to the east bay to test their product in a real world setting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">According to cofounder and CEO Felipe Chavez Cortes, the company has already fulfilled more than 10,000 orders with its team of delivery \u2018bots. It\u2019s a differentiator in an increasingly crowded world of delivery robots, for whom testing on city sidewalks has presented a host of issues. In December of last year, San Francisco went so far as banning delivery \u2018bots from city streets for fear of a robotic sidewalk takeover.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1646153\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/screen-shot-2018-05-25-at-2-44-49-pm.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"563\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Being based within spitting distance of the Berkeley campus has proven useful for the company\u2019s testing, both with regards to access and the seemingly endless resource that is hungry college students. The robots\u2019 smaller size also allows means they don\u2019t monopolize sidewalk space like some of the competition. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI believe that sidewalks are sacred, and we need to create technology that interacts with people the best way possible,\u201d says<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Cortes. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re using several kinds of robots. This size works for 80 percent of the orders.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Another key differentiator is Kiwi\u2019s more modular approach to delivery. Rather than relying on a single robot to do all of the heavy lifting, the little four-wheeled \u2018bot is designed with just the final 300 meters in mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1646154\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/screen-shot-2018-05-25-at-2-45-30-pm.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"583\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe started with one robot going from the restaurant to the customer\u2019s house and found out pretty easily that that was inefficient,\u201d says<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>Cortes. \u201cSo we created a multi-modal system. We have three robots: one inside the restaurant, a semi-autonomous tricycle that goes in the streets and we have the last-mile robots. We have robots deployed in the city, and then, with the trikes, we can pick up dozens of meals at once and then we load the robots. The robot makes the last 300 meters. It works. Right now it\u2019s cheaper than using human couriers, and the companies have control of the delivery.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1646155\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/screen-shot-2018-05-25-at-2-45-12-pm.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"607\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For now, Kiwi is a plucky startup, still working out of the accelerator that birthed it. The company still has a lot to grapple with, in order to make a solution that makes sense on a wider<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>scale, including fully autonomous navigation and issues with potential theft of the technology, once the robots extend beyond the Berkeley campus.

In January, for example, a\u00a0U.S. District Court judge\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/business\/hollywood\/la-fi-ct-tickbox-studios-20180130-story.html\">handed down a preliminary injunction<\/a> against TickBox TV, a Georgia-based set-top box maker that was profiting from the sale of its so-called &#8220;Kodi boxes.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"card collection-item\" data-type=\"text\">\n<div class=\" card-content \">\n<p>Columbia Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Disney, 20th Century Fox Film, Universal Pictures and Warner Bros. were also plaintiffs in that case, along with Netflix and Amazon.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Amazon and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/ebay\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"ebay\">eBay <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> also proactively remove devices facilitating piracy from their websites, the <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/federal-communications-commission\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"federal-communications-commission\">FCC <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> acknowledged in its letter.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon, for example, prevented the sale of &#8220;tens of thousands of unlawful devices&#8221; through its &#8220;automated proactive detection, preventative investigations, and notices of infringement from rights holders,&#8221; the letter stated. Ebay, meanwhile, also removes devices reported as infringing and removes those that say things like &#8220;never pay another cable bill&#8221; or &#8220;fully loaded&#8221; in their descriptions.<\/p>\n<p>But the FCC wants the companies to do more, and faster, it seems.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, despite your good work in this area, devices continue to make it to consumers through your website,&#8221; writes FCC Commissioner Mike O&#8217;Rielly. &#8220;Many of these devices contain harmful malware that will most certainly be passed on to the consumer. Moreover, the consumer may unwittingly believe that the device is lawful since they were able to purchase it from a legitimate company.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The FCC is additionally concerned because many devices use the FCC logo to aid in their attempt to defraud consumers.<\/p>\n<p>It notes that nine set-top box distributors were referred to the FCC in October for streaming pirated content, and seven of those displayed the FCC logo even though there was no record of their compliance with the commission&#8217;s requirements.<\/p>\n<p>The letter specifically asks both Amazon and eBay to step up their enforcement, by &#8220;swiftly removing&#8221; devices the FCC alerts them to; it also asks the companies to provide the FCC with information about the manufacturers, distributors and suppliers, when requested.<\/p>\n<p>The move not only pushes Amazon and eBay to more quickly and thoroughly cooperate with the FCC, it also serves as a warning about the U.S. government&#8217;s plan to further its crackdown on these fake pay TV boxes.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, there&#8217;s a bit of irony here regarding Amazon&#8217;s participation in this fight &#8212; its Amazon Fire TV Stick, or &#8220;firestick&#8221; as consumers tend to refer to it, is one of the most popular devices out there today for enabling piracy.<\/p>\n<p>People either buy the &#8220;firestick&#8221; themselves and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.groundedreason.com\/illegal-jailbreak-fire-stick\/\">install Kodi and various add-ons<\/a>\u00a0or they buy a slightly more expensive, hacked firestick from a local reseller who&#8217;s hawking them on under-the-radar backchannels, like Facebook Groups or online message boards. The hacked firestick is set up with Kodi pre-installed and the various add-ons for free streaming already configured. (A search for &#8220;kodi box&#8221; on Amazon.com also returns the Fire TV Stick and Fire TV as the top two results thanks to &#8220;sponsored&#8221; placements by Amazon. <em>Hmmm<\/em>.)<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. is not alone in its Kodi box crackdown. Recently, business owners in Wales who sold fully loaded Kodi boxes were <a href=\"https:\/\/torrentfreak.com\/fully-loaded-kodi-box-sellers-receive-hefty-jail-sentences-180524\/\">sentenced to prison,\u00a0<\/a>for example, and its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thesun.co.uk\/tech\/3425932\/kodi-boxes-are-illegal-if-sold-fully-loaded-european-court-rules\/\">courts have ruled<\/a> Kodi boxes illegal before. <a href=\"https:\/\/torrentfreak.com\/tvaddons-suffers-big-setback-as-court-completely-overturns-earlier-ruling-180221\/\">Canada<\/a> has gone after websites that enable piracy through Kodi, as well.<\/p>\n<p>In response to the letter, eBay says it plans to cooperate with the FCC:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We\u2019re committed to working in collaboration with the FCC to prevent the sale of these illegal products. As outlined in the letter, eBay utilizes a variety of measures to prevent these products from being sold on our platform. These include proactive filtering and manual site reviews to identify illegal products, as well as taking action on direct referrals received from the FCC. We look forward to continuing to work in partnership with the FCC to keep these illegal products off our site.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><del>Amazon has not yet responded to a request for comment.<\/del><\/p>\n<p>Amazon has shared its statement, which was written in its own letter to the FCC.<\/p>\n<iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" src=\"\/\/www.scribd.com\/embeds\/380490498\/content?start_page=1&view_mode=&access_key=key-GnXrRfo2HVAX0MVgamPA\" data-auto-height=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"scribd_380490498\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\n<div style=\"font-size:10px;text-align:center;width:100%\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.scribd.com\/doc\/380490498\" target=\"_blank\">View this document on Scribd<\/a><\/div>\n<p><em>(h\/t: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fiercecable.com\/regulatory\/fcc-s-o-rielly-asks-amazon-and-ebay-to-stop-selling-bogus-pay-tv-set-tops\">FireceCable<\/a>)\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On Friday, the Federal Communications Commission sent a letter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and eBay CEO Devin Wenig asking their companies to help remove the listings for fake pay TV boxes from their respective websites.

For one, according to a series of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.documentcloud.org\/documents\/4487118-Facebook-Hatespeech-Slides-1.html\">internal slides on white supremacy,<\/a>\u00a0Facebook walks a fine line that arguably doesn&#8217;t exist at all. According to these post-Charlottesville training documents, the company opted to officially differentiate between white nationalism and white supremacy, allowing the former and forbidding the latter.<\/p>\n<h2>White nationalism gets the green light<\/h2>\n<p>Facebook appears to take the distinction between white nationalism and white supremacy seriously, but many white nationalists don&#8217;t, opting only for the slightly more benign term to soften their image. This is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bostonglobe.com\/news\/nation\/2017\/08\/14\/clash-highlights-extremists-skill-bending-words\/EQZAyrZrOiLki5gWsJc03H\/story.html\">well-<\/a>documented phenomenon, as anyone who has spent time in these online circles can attest. It&#8217;s also the first sentence in the Anti Defamation League (ADL) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adl.org\/resources\/glossary-terms\/white-nationalism\">entry on white nationalism<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>White nationalism is a term that originated among white supremacists as a euphemism for white supremacy.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually, some white supremacists tried to distinguish it further by using it to refer to a form of white supremacy that emphasizes defining a country or region by white racial identity and which seeks to promote the interests of whites exclusively, typically at the expense of people of other backgrounds.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>As <a href=\"https:\/\/motherboard.vice.com\/en_us\/article\/mbk7ky\/leaked-facebook-neo-nazi-policies-white-supremacy-nationalism-separatism\">Motherboard<\/a> reports, Facebook notes &#8220;overlaps with white nationalism\/separatism&#8221; as a challenge in its relevant training notes section for white supremacy, adding that &#8220;Media reports also use the terms interchangeably (for example referring to David Duke as white supremacist even though he doesn&#8217;t explicitly identify himself as one).&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Facebook&#8217;s own articulation of white supremacy offers considerable concessions:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Although there doesn&#8217;t seem to be total agreement among academics on whether white supremacy <strong>always\u00a0<\/strong>implies racial\u00a0<strong>hatred<\/strong>, the fact that it is based on a <strong>racist premise<\/strong>\u00a0is widely acknowledged. [original emphasis]<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Most of Facebook&#8217;s slides on hate speech and hate groups read like an embarrassingly\u00a0simplistic CliffsNotes, lacking nuance and revealing the company&#8217;s apparently slapdash approach to the issue of racial hate. Tellingly, some portions of Facebook&#8217;s training text copy Wikipedia&#8217;s own language verbatim.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the first few sentences of the Wikipedia entry on white supremacy:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>White supremacy or white supremacism is a racist ideology based upon the belief that white people are superior in many ways to people of other races and that therefore white people should be dominant over other races.<\/p>\n<p>White supremacy has roots in scientific racism and it often relies on pseudoscientific arguments. Like most similar movements such as neo-Nazism, white supremacists typically oppose members of other races as well as Jews.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Facebook&#8217;s training note on white supremacy, with differences bolded:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>White supremacy or white supremacism is a racist ideology based upon the belief that white people are superior in many ways to people of other races and that therefore white people should be dominant over other races. White supremacy has roots in scientific racism and it often relies on pseudoscientific arguments. Like most similar movements such as neo-Nazism, white supremacists typically oppose <strong>people of color, Jews and non-Protestants.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<div id=\"attachment_1647356\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1647356 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/screen-shot-2018-05-29-at-12-03-04-pm.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Facebook slides recreated by Motherboard<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Bafflingly, Facebook also notes that &#8220;White nationalism and calling for an exclusively white state is not a violation for our policy unless it explicitly excludes other PCs [protected characteristics]&#8221; which by definition, a white state does.<\/p>\n<p>According to slides recreated by Motherboard, Facebook asserts that &#8220;we don&#8217;t allow praise, support and representation of\u00a0<strong>white supremacy<\/strong> as an ideology&#8221; but stipulates that it does &#8220;allow praise, support and representation&#8221; for both white nationalism and white separatism. [Again, emphasis theirs.]<\/p>\n<p>Facebook further clarifies:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>By the same token, we allow to call for the creation of white ethno-states (e.g. &#8220;The US should be a white-only nation&#8221;).<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>White supremacy versus white nationalism<\/h2>\n<p>By failing to recognize the political motivations behind white nationalism as an identity, Facebook legitimates white nationalism as something meaningfully distinct from white supremacy. While not all white nationalists call for the dream of a white ethnostate to be achieved through racial domination \u2014 and arguably the two could be studied distinctly from a purely academic perspective \u2014 they have far more in common than they have differences. Even with such thin sourcing, Facebook has devoted a surprising amount of language to differentiating the two.<\/p>\n<p>In grappling with this question after\u00a0Charlottesville, the <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.ap.org\/behind-the-news\/how-to-describe-extremists-who-rallied-in-charlottesville\">Associated Press<\/a> offered this clarification for its own coverage:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>For many people the terms can be used almost interchangeably. Both terms describe groups that favor whites and support discrimination by race.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The AP also mentions the &#8220;subtle difference&#8221; that white supremacists believe whites to be superior.<\/p>\n<p>For white nationalists, that attitude at times appears more implicit than explicit but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not there. From my own reading and considerable hours spent immersed online in white nationalist groups and forums, there is massive observable ideological overlap between the two groups. The instances in which white supremacists and white nationalists truly espouse wholly distinct ideologies are rare.<\/p>\n<p>Further, it&#8217;s impossible to ignore that violence against non-whites is a central thread running throughout white nationalism, whether stated or implied. Imagining a white ethnostate that does not directly come about at the cost of the safety, wellbeing and financial security of racial minorities is pure fantasy \u2014 a fantasy Facebook is apparently content to entertain in pretending that the &#8220;white state&#8221; would not &#8220;explicitly exclude&#8221; anyone based on the protected characteristic of race.<\/p>\n<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC)\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.splcenter.org\/fighting-hate\/extremist-files\/ideology\/white-nationalist\">defines white nationalism<\/a> in similarly broad strokes, tying it directly to white supremacy and stating that\u00a0&#8220;white nationalist groups espouse white supremacist or white separatist ideologies, often focusing on the alleged inferiority of nonwhites.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The SPLC, an organization devoted to studying hate, explains the expedient fallacy of the white ethnostate as a nonviolent goal:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>These racist aspirations are most commonly articulated as the desire to form a white ethnostate \u2014 a calculated idiom favored by white nationalists in order to obscure the inherent violence of such a radical project. Appeals for the white ethnostate are often disingenuously couched in proclamations of love for members of their own race, rather than hatred for others.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Apparently, Facebook ignored most dissenting definitions linking white nationalist goals directly to white supremacy. Naively or not, the company bought into white supremacy&#8217;s slightly more palatable public-facing image in shaping its policy platforms.\u00a0In sourcing its policies, Facebook was apparently content to pick and choose which points supported its decision to allow white nationalism on its platform while supposedly casting out white supremacy.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;White nationalist groups espouse white separatism and white supremacy,&#8221; the Wikipedia page that Facebook drew from states.\u00a0&#8220;Critics argue that the term &#8216;white nationalism&#8217; and ideas such as white pride exist solely to provide a sanitized public face for white supremacy, and that most white nationalist groups promote racial violence.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, for anyone who has watched many virulent strains of racism <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/08\/16\/hatespeech-white-supremacy-nazis-social-networks\/\">flourish and even organize on Facebook<\/a>, the company&#8217;s shoddily crafted internal guidance on white supremacy comes as little surprise. Nor does the fact that the company failed to dedicate even a sliver of its considerable resources to understanding the nuance of white supremacist movements, aims and language.<\/p>\n<p>We reached out to Facebook to see if these alarmingly reductive policies on racial hate have evolved in recent months (these materials are less than a year old), but the company only pointed us to the broad public-facing\u00a0 &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/communitystandards\/introduction\/\">Community Standards<\/a>.&#8221; Any further detail on the actual implementation of policies around hate remains opaque.<\/p>\n<p>Though it may have learned some harsh lessons in 2018, for Facebook, opacity is always the best policy.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In an ongoing series over at Motherboard, we&#8217;re learning quite a bit about how Facebook polices hate speech and hate organizations on its platform.

In fact, Snap&#8217;s terms of service still say &#8220;You will not use or develop any third-party applications that interact with the Services or other users\u2019 content or information without our written consent.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">A year ago I wrote that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/04\/19\/no-snapplat\/\">&#8220;Snap&#8217;s anti-developer attitude is an augmented liability&#8221;<\/a> since it would be tough to populate the physical world with AR experiences unless it has help like Facebook had started recruiting. By December, Snapchat had launched <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/12\/14\/snapchat-developer-platform\/\">Lens Studio<\/a>, which lets brands and developers build limited AR content for the app. And it&#8217;s been building out its<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/09\/20\/snapchat-instant-ads\/\"> cadre of marketing and analytics partners<\/a>\u00a0with which brands can work.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"AHUvksqefn\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/04\/19\/no-snapplat\/\">Snap&#8217;s anti-developer attitude is an augmented liability<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/04\/19\/no-snapplat\/embed\/#?secret=AHUvksqefn\" data-secret=\"AHUvksqefn\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" title=\"&#8220;Snap&#8217;s anti-developer attitude is an augmented liability&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Yet until now, Snapchat hadn&#8217;t created functionality that developers could use in their own apps. Snapkit will change that. We don&#8217;t know when it will be announced or launched, or who will be the initial developers who take advantage of it. But with Snapchat slipping to its lowest user growth rate ever after being pummeled by competition from Facebook and Instagram, the company needs more than a puppy face filter to regain the spotlight.<\/p>\n<h2>SnapPlat<\/h2>\n<p><img class=\" wp-image-1502465 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/snapchat-partners.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"307\" \/>According to sources familiar with Snap&#8217;s discussions with potential developers, Snapkit&#8217;s login with Snapchat feature is designed to let users sign up for new apps with their Snapchat credentials instead of creating new ones. Because Snap doesn&#8217;t collect much personal info about you, unlike Facebook, there&#8217;s less data to worry about accidentally giving to developers or them misusing. Displaying its branded button on various app&#8217;s signup pages could lure in new Snapchat users or reengage lapsed ones. It&#8217;s also the key to developing tighter ties between Snap and other apps, even if users sign up for apps another way.<\/p>\n<p>One benefit of another app knowing who you are on Snapchat, which the company plans to provide with Snapkit, is the ability to bring your Bitmoji avatar with you. <a href=\"https:\/\/beta.techcrunch.com\/2016\/03\/25\/snapchat-reportedly-acquires-bitmoji-maker-bitstrips-for-100-million\/\">Snapchat acquired<\/a> Bitmoji&#8217;s parent company Bitstrips for<a href=\"https:\/\/beta.techcrunch.com\/2017\/02\/02\/snap-paid-150-million-to-acquire-looksery-and-64-2-million-for-bitstrips\/?_ga=2.196138860.1131222547.1527608989-1361550980.1392837599\"> just $64.2 million<\/a> in 2016, but the cartoonish personalized avatar app has been a staple of the top 10 chart since. It remains one of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/10\/10\/facemoji\/\">Snapchat&#8217;s most differentiated offerings<\/a>, as Facebook has only recently begun work on its clone called <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/07\/facebook-avatars\/\">Facebook Avatars<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>While Bitmoji has offered a keyboard full of your avatar in different scenes, Snapkit could make it easy to add yours as stickers on photos or in other ways in third-party apps. Seeing them across the mobile universe could inspire more users to create their own Bitmoji lookalike.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1635182\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/bitmoji-original.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"391\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Snapchat is also working on a way for developers to integrate its editing tool-laden and AR-equipped camera into their own apps. Instead of having to reinvent the wheel if they want to permit visual sharing and inevitably building a poor knockoff, apps could just add Snapchat&#8217;s polished camera. The idea is the photos and videos shot with the camera could then be used in that app as well as shared back to Snapchat. Similar to Facebook and Instagram Stories opening up to posts from third-parties, this could inject fresh forms of content into Snapchat at a time when usage is slipping.<\/p>\n<p>Launching a platform also means Snapchat will take on new risks, as third-parties with access to user data could be breached. Snap also will have to convince developers that making it easier for its 191 million daily users to join their apps is worth the engineering resources, given how that community is dwarfed by the multi-billion user Google and Facebook login systems. Login with Snapchat could be especially popular with teen-focused anonymous, or dating, apps you don&#8217;t want connected to your Facebook profile.<\/p>\n<p>Snapchat has struggled to get out of Facebook&#8217;s shadow despite inventing or acquiring what would become some of the hottest trends in social. Yet Snap Inc. could develop alliances with a platform that leverages its differentiators &#8212; a teen audience that doesn&#8217;t care for Facebook, inherent privacy and custom avatars. Through an army of developers, Snapchat might find the firepower to challenge the blue empire.<\/p>\n<p><em>For more on Snapchat and its competitors, check out our other coverage:<\/em><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"CGOaCGIsJd\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/01\/snapchat-q1-2018-earnings\/\">Snapchat slips in Q1 to its slowest user growth rate ever, shares fall 15%<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/01\/snapchat-q1-2018-earnings\/embed\/#?secret=CGOaCGIsJd\" data-secret=\"CGOaCGIsJd\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" title=\"&#8220;Snapchat slips in Q1 to its slowest user growth rate ever, shares fall 15%&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Yvr2441X5T\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/07\/facebook-avatars\/\">&#8216;Facebook Avatars&#8217; is its new clone of Snapchat&#8217;s Bitmoji<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/07\/facebook-avatars\/embed\/#?secret=Yvr2441X5T\" data-secret=\"Yvr2441X5T\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" title=\"&#8220;&#8216;Facebook Avatars&#8217; is its new clone of Snapchat&#8217;s Bitmoji&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"mRbH7vjmt0\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/11\/13\/time-to-snap-into-action\/\">Snapchat&#8217;s epic strategy flip-flop<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/11\/13\/time-to-snap-into-action\/embed\/#?secret=mRbH7vjmt0\" data-secret=\"mRbH7vjmt0\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" title=\"&#8220;Snapchat&#8217;s epic strategy flip-flop&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Snapchat is secretly planning the launch of its first full-fledged developer platform, currently called Snapkit.

Vulcan Cyber is that as businesses continue to increase the pace at which they build and adopt new software, the risk of introducing vulnerabilities only increases. But at the same time, most companies don&#8217;t have the tools in place to automatically detect and mitigate these issues, meaning that it can often take weeks before a patch rolls out.<\/p>\n<p>The company argues that its position in the cybersecurity space is somewhat unique because it doesn&#8217;t just focus on detecting vulnerabilities but also helps businesses remediate them. All users have to do is give Vulcan access to the APIs of their existing vulnerability, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/devops\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"devops\">DevOps <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and IT tools and the service will simply take over from there. It then watches over both the infrastructure as well as the code that runs on it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text\/html' width='640' height='390' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/VQSRiVftkt0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It might sound more glamorous to talk about zero-day and next-generation threats, but vulnerability remediation is truly where the rubber meets the road,&#8221; said Yaniv Bar-Dayan, Vulcan Cyber&#8217;s CEO and co-founder. &#8220;The only way to deal with this continuous risk exposure is through continuous remediation, achieved with robust data collection, advanced analytics, automation, and closed-loop remediation planning, orchestration and validation.

media content, starting with podcasts. Today, it&#8217;s making good on that promise by launching support for podcasts into beta, along with a whole new look and more customization options for its <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/plex\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"plex\">Plex <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> mobile apps.<\/p>\n<p>While Plex got its start as a software application for organizing people&#8217;s home media collections, it&#8217;s been expanding over the past couple of years to add new features in support of cord cutters who want to watch TV via their antenna, and <a href=\"https:\/\/beta.techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/01\/plex-goes-after-cord-cutters-with-new-dvr-feature\/\">record<\/a> those shows.

(It had originally expected to add podcasts in Q1 2018, so this nearly-June launch is a bit of a delay.)<\/p>\n<p>The larger goal, on Plex&#8217;s part, is to organize all your media content in one place &#8211; from live and recorded TV to your personal media collections of music, photos, and videos, and your news and information &#8211; including, now, your favorite podcasts.<\/p>\n<p>The feature, live today in beta, is available on the Plex web platform, Roku, and iOS and Android, with other device support coming soon.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1647810\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/plex-podcasts-web-app-my-podcasts1.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"490\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can browse and search across Plex&#8217;s podcast library, filter podcasts by categories, or click into a title to see the details, episode lists, and related podcasts. To follow that podcast, you click the &#8220;Add to My Podcasts&#8221; button. This will add the podcast to your &#8220;On Deck&#8221; dashboard, as well.<\/p>\n<p>If the podcast you like isn&#8217;t in the Plex catalog, you can add it by entering the feed URL, and Plex will treat it as if it is &#8211; it will retrieve all its metadata, related podcasts, and make it searchable. (That&#8217;s useful because Plex&#8217;s catalog isn&#8217;t as robust as others at launch.)<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1647788\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/plex-podcast-categories.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"284\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The feature also includes the standard media controls you&#8217;d expect, like forward and back and support for variable speed playback, as well as a &#8220;mark as played&#8221; option, all available through Plex&#8217;s upgraded media player. That option can help you transition to Plex&#8217;s podcast platform from another app, as you won&#8217;t have to lose your place, in terms of what you&#8217;ve listened to, and what you&#8217;ve not. And it lets you continually mark off any episodes you may have caught elsewhere, or just otherwise want to skip.<\/p>\n<p>Your listening progress is also synced across Plex&#8217;s suite of apps.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"vertical alignnone size-large wp-image-1647797\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/plex-podcasts-pre-play.jpg?w=333\" alt=\"\" width=\"333\" height=\"680\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The feature wasn&#8217;t perfect in brief testing, but it was in a pre-launch state, and today it&#8217;s only arriving in beta &#8211; so it&#8217;s too soon to speak to how well it performs as a publicly-facing product.<\/p>\n<p>In a few weeks, Plex will roll out a handful of other features for podcasts, including smart downloading with granular controls for managing the episodes you want to keep on a per show basis (e.g. keep the last three); additional metadata for richer show pages and better discovery options; and podcasts import and export (OPML) so you can move your current subscriptions more easily into Plex.<\/p>\n<p>Along with the launch of podcasts, Plex is updating its mobile apps, too, to offer better customization options.<\/p>\n<p>Now, if you want to listen to your podcasts and news while you&#8217;re on the go, on mobile, you can configure the app to show that media on your home screen. Or, if you use the app more for casting your videos to your living room TV, you could bring those favorite shows to the front of the experience instead. And so on.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"vertical alignnone size-large wp-image-1647800\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/screenshot_20180529-180851.png?w=383\" alt=\"\" width=\"383\" height=\"680\" \/><\/p>\n<p>On this new, customizable home screen you can re-order you content, remove any of its sections (like &#8220;Recently Added&#8221; or &#8220;On Deck,&#8221;), or add new ones from elsewhere in the app, including across servers (like Plex Cloud or your local server such as your home PC.)<\/p>\n<p>Plex has also added tabs at the bottom of the screen for switching between your media type (e.g. movies, TV, podcasts, etc.), which are fully customizable, too. You can even customize the default source for each media type.<\/p>\n[gallery ids=\"1647814,1647815,1647813,1647812,1647811,1647806,1647805,1647803,1647802,1647799,1647795\"]\n<p>The addition of podcasts to this more personalized media experience makes sense not only because of how popular podcasts have become, but also because many are tied to the shows you watch &#8211; they&#8217;re creator commentaries, roundtable discussions, fan chats, critic reviews, and more. It&#8217;s easy to imagine, then, moving from watching a show on the TV then heading out and launching the Plex app to listen to the podcast discussing the last episode.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the vision Plex has, at least. However, even with these additions, Plex&#8217;s software overall still caters more to the DIY crowd &#8211; those who want set up their own antenna, rather than pay for an online TV service like YouTube TV or Sling. And it hasn&#8217;t yet solved the problem of media that&#8217;s all over the place &#8211; favorite shows and movies are strewn across services like Netflix, Hulu, HBO, and Amazon, and it&#8217;s hard to know where the things you want to watch reside. Those are still challenges Plex could attack in the future, by becoming a hub that jumps you into streaming catalogs, too.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s unclear how well Plex&#8217;s expansions have been working to attract new users and paying subscribers.<\/p>\n<p>The company doesn&#8217;t break out the latter figure. and it still claims today the same 15 million registered users it had at the beginning of the year.

advances in hardware and big data analytics, a startup called <a href=\"http:\/\/avawomen.com\">Ava<\/a>, which has built a $199 wearable device and app to help women track their fertility cycles, has raised $30 million to expand into other aspects of female health.<\/p>\n<p>The funding &#8212; led by unnamed existing investors plus new backers btov and SVC &#8212; comes at a time of fast growth for the company. Ava says it has now enabled 10,000 pregnancies, or &#8220;Ava babies&#8221; as they have sometimes been called. As a point of reference, in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/11\/15\/ava-the-fertility-wearable-raises-9-7m-to-help-families-conceive\/\">late 2016<\/a>, around when the company &#8212; founded in Zurich and now co-based also in San Francisco &#8212; had raised a Series A round of $9.7 million, the company had tracked only 7 Ava babies due in 2017.<\/p>\n<p>Lea von Bidder, Ava&#8217;s CEO and co-founder holding down the fort in SF (her co-founders Pascal Koenig, Peter Stein, and Philipp Tholen are based in Zurich) says that the company is not disclosing its valuation with this round. It brings the total raised by the company to $42.3 million since 2014 (showing off its device for the first time as part of our <a href=\"https:\/\/beta.techcrunch.com\/2015\/09\/22\/ava-is-a-bracelet-that-aims-to-predict-the-most-likely-days-for-women-to-get-pregnant\/?_ga=2.31261302.8309888.1527582655-1960936357.1517502256\">Battlefield competition in 2015<\/a>), with previous investors including Khosla Ventures, Swisscom, DCM and more.<\/p>\n<p>For some more context, other leading fertility startups (coincidentally also out of Europe) Clue and Natural Cycles have raised $30 million and $37.5 million respectively.<\/p>\n<p>While Clue and Natural Cycles have focused on software &#8212; specifically, apps that track different markers that are either collected by the user inputting information directly, or by way of tapping diagnostics from other wearables (Clue, for example, has a Fitbit integration) &#8212; Ava&#8217;s unique selling point has been how it has married <a href=\"https:\/\/beta.techcrunch.com\/2016\/07\/26\/ava-launches-a-wearable-to-help-couples-conceive\/?_ga=2.31261302.8309888.1527582655-1960936357.1517502256\">hardware development<\/a> with advanced analytical software to read multiple diagnostics from its wearable and to use those analytics to help draw conclusions about what a woman&#8217;s body is doing.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Everything we do is artificial intelligence,&#8221; Von Bidder said of the analytics part. &#8220;We are clearly an AI company in the end. It&#8217;s just a fancy term for big data analytics and that is exactly what we do. When you think about what Ava does, we are measuring your body and understanding it, and the only way we could do that is with AI.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Building a wearable can pose many challenges in the form of manufacturing, capital outlay, and simply getting people to buy them &#8212; hardware, as the tech world likes to say, is indeed hard. But when a company gets it right, building a vertically integrated business that brings in both together can prove to be a compelling business.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of Eva, all the measurements &#8212; there are nine diagnostics being collected, including\u00a0heartrate, body fat, heat loss, and sleep movement, all of which are lined up with indicators of other physiological changes &#8212; are taken while a person is sleeping every night, removing some of the possibility for human error in the collection phase. And when you consider that many of the current products to measure your fertility are based either on a thermometer or a urine test, a wristband you need to remember to slip on at night might seem like a significantly cleaner and easier alternative.<\/p>\n<p>While Eva continues to build out its existing operations, the bigger picture, Von Bidder said, is the company&#8217;s plans for where it plans to take its business next.<\/p>\n<p>Today, the company&#8217;s &#8220;sweet spot&#8221; for customers are women who are trying to conceive a child but have not been immediately successful, yet have not yet passed the one-year mark of trying, which is typically when those women might start to turn to medical help to get pregnant.<\/p>\n<p>Eva is currently running a host of clinical trials not only to extend the kind of help it can offer other categories of women who want to get pregnant &#8212; for example those with pre-existing complications, and those who have been trying for more than a year &#8212; but also women who might not want to get pregnant at all. That is, helping with contraception, or with other phases of women&#8217;s reproductive health, such as menopause.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The overall vision of the app is to become a companion for all of a woman&#8217;s different life stages, including trying to prevent pregnancy and menopause,&#8221; said Von Bidder.<\/p>\n<p>A large part of the investment being announced today will be going funding more clinical trials, which are based at the\u00a0University Hospital of Zurich with Professor Brigitte Leeners and cover areas like fertility challenges and pregnancy complications (which itself is another huge area, and leads Ava into one of the least understood aspects of pregnancy: miscarriage, especially those that happen in the first trimester).

Its SQL analytical database, called SQream DB, uses thousands of parallel processing cores in NVIDIA GPUs to allow large companies to perform big data analytics more quickly and cheaply (SQream claims its clients can \u201canalyze up to 20 times more data, up to 100 times faster, at as little 10% of the cost\u201d).<\/p>\n<p>SQream co-founder and CEO Ami Gal told TechCrunch that one of SQream\u2019s main differentiators from other GPU databases, like Kinetica and MapD, is its ability to adapt to increasingly massive hoards of data. Kinetica and MapD use in-memory storage, so while they can analyze up to about 5 terabytes of data extremely quickly, their scalability is limited. On the other hand, SQream was created to handle data stores of up to hundreds of terabytes.<\/p>\n<p>The company\u2019s Series B capital is being used to add new feature to SQream DB and grow its sales, marketing and delivery teams as it focuses on the Chinese market and other regions. In addition to Alibaba Cloud, SQream\u2019s other new customers in Asia include Thai mobile operator AIS and India\u2019s ACL Mobile, an enterprise messaging service.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SQream, the GPU database developer, will deepen its focus on China after raising a $26.4 million Series B led by Alibaba Group.

data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"scoot-41f1\">Scoot, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> the electric moped company that first launched in San Francisco, is deploying two new modes of transportation in Barcelona. The first is an upgrade of its original scooter that the company deploys in San Francisco. Instead of maxing out at 30 mph, this new moped can go up to 60 mph. The second mode of transportation is a good old-fashioned pedal assist bicycle. To support Scoot&#8217;s ambitions in Barcelona, the company has a team of 20 people based in the European city.<\/p>\n<p>Specifically, Scoot will deploy 1,000 bicycles that can lock to bike locks and other city infrastructure. Scoot will also deploy 500 electric scooters, designed by Silence. These mopeds are designed to not only drive faster, but also be more durable and carry up to two people. But Scoot won&#8217;t be the only shared electric moped and bicycle service in Barcelona. Instead, it will join the likes of moped startups Yugo and eCooltra, and bike-share startup Bicing.<\/p>\n<p>Scoot is hoping to also launch its stationless bikes in San Francisco, but can&#8217;t for a little while due to the fact the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/01\/09\/jump-will-be-the-first-stationless-e-bike-sharing-startup-to-launch-in-sf\/\">city has an exclusive permit with bike-share service JUMP<\/a> (now owned by Uber) until next June. However, Scoot founder and CEO Michael Keating told me he&#8217;s hopeful the city will change it&#8217;s mind, saying, &#8220;we would like to think we&#8217;d be able to convince the city to let us do it before the JUMP pilot ends.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1647305\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"breakout wp-image-1647305 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/img_1152.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1626\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Scoot CEO Michael Keating at the company&#8217;s SF HQ<\/p><\/div>\n<p>That&#8217;s because Scoot has been working with the city since 2012, and has, in Keating&#8217;s mind, proven its ability to work well with cities.\u00a0Scoot was quite early to the concept of shared <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/mobility\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"mobility\">mobility <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> that you can leave and pickup anywhere. Fast forward a few years and now we see Lime, Bird, Spin and JUMP hitting the streets with electric scooters and bikes. Despite the entrance of several new mobility players in San Francisco, Keating said Scoot hasn&#8217;t seen any dips in ridership.<\/p>\n<p>Whether Scoot gets into stand-on scooters remains to be seen. Keating said he recognizes they&#8217;re a &#8220;cool product&#8221; but he has an issue with how often people ride them on sidewalks. You may also remember when <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/10\/17\/scoot-unleashes-new-four-wheeler-quad-cars-on-san-francisco-streets\/\">Scoot launched ten of those mini electric cars<\/a> that could hold up to two people. Scoot has since pulled them from the streets, but Keating said the company is currently looking for the right electric car for San Francisco.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Scoot, the electric moped company that first launched in San Francisco, is deploying two new modes of transportation in Barcelona.

The company is behind some of the most promising enterprise startups in recent years.<\/p>\n<p>Over the past six months, six <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/efounders\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"efounders\">eFounders <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> startups have raised $120 million in total, with <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/01\/24\/front-raises-66-million-to-replace-microsoft-outlook\/\">Front<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/15\/aircall-raises-another-29-million\/\">Aircall<\/a> leading the pack with a $66 million and a $29 million round. Spendesk <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/01\/30\/spendesk-raises-99-million-to-build-your-next-corporate-card\/\">raised<\/a> $9.9 million. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/01\/16\/forest-raises-37-million-for-its-administration-interface-to-rule-them-all\/\">Forest<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/23\/slite-raises-4-4m-to-create-a-smarter-internal-notes-tool\/\">Slite<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/10\/26\/station-combines-all-your-messy-web-apps-into-a-single-app\/\">Station<\/a> raised seed rounds.<\/p>\n<p>Some of them also attended Y Combinator\u2019s most recent batch. Finally, Technicis <a href=\"http:\/\/tech.eu\/brief\/textmaster-technicis\/\">acquired<\/a> TextMaster for an undisclosed sum.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t know the eFounders model, it\u2019s quite simple. At first, the core eFounders team comes up with an idea and hires a founding team. In exchange for financial and human resources, eFounders keep a significant stake in its startups.<\/p>\n<p>After a year or two, startups should have proven that they can raise a seed round and operate on their own. This way, eFounders can move on to the next project and start new companies.<\/p>\n<p>eFounders currently lists 14 companies <a href=\"https:\/\/www.efounders.co\">on its website<\/a>. In addition to the ones I already mentioned, there are Mailjet, Mention, Foxintelligence, Forest, Hivy, Folk, Upflow, Briq and Illustrio.<\/p>\n<p>Based on this list, you\u2019d think that eFounders has a nearly perfect track record. But eFounders had to stop a couple of projects, such as PressKing and Muxi. Illustrio seems to be on pause right now as well.<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, it\u2019s clear that eFounders has cooked up a secret playbook for software-as-a-service startups. More importantly, it\u2019s also clear that eFounders managed to attract some talented entrepreneurs to lead those startups and transform them into their own startups.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, eFounders companies have raised $175 million in total, have 100,000 clients and 500 employees. Together, they generate $50 million in revenue. eFounders itself has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/efounders#section-past-team\">raised<\/a> $11.4 million.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s going to be a long play for eFounders as the company only generates revenue when there&#8217;s an exit or a secondary market transaction. As long as startups keep raising more money, eFounders doesn&#8217;t get anything, and its stake gets diluted. It&#8217;ll only make money when there&#8217;s a significant acquisition or an IPO. But the valuation of eFounders&#8217; portfolio also keeps growing, so the outcome looks more and more positive.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>European startup studio eFounders is slowly but surely building a portfolio of successful software-as-a-service startups.

It won\u2019t cost you anything to apply or to participate. No fees, that\u2019s our motto.

Startup Battlefield is the best platform for launching your company to the world. And that\u2019s not just our opinion.

We also met a community of amazing founders and the family at TechCrunch, who have helped us grow ever since. If you&#8217;re launching a new company or product, this is the stage you want to be on.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re selected by our team of highly discriminating editors, you\u2019ll receive expert pitch coaching to get you primed and ready to do battle. Teams get six minutes to make their pitch to an expert panel of judges \u2014 and then answer any questions the judges may have for them.<\/p>\n<p>The Battlefield stage has a live audience packed with literally thousands of entrepreneurs, tech founders, investors and media. We also live-stream it to the world on TechCrunch.com, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. And it\u2019ll be available later, on demand. It\u2019s the kind of exposure startup founders dream of experiencing.<\/p>\n<p>And if you do compete, your company becomes part of a very exclusive club: The Startup Battlefield alumni community. This group of more than 800 companies has collectively raised more than $8 billion in funding and produced more than 100 exits. You may recognize a few of them: Mint, Dropbox, Yammer, Fitbit, Getaround and Cloudflare.

It enables companies who have road freight shipping needs in Spain and more recently the U.K. to connect with the startup&#8217;s network of over 2,200 lorry drivers operating in both countries.<\/p>\n<p>For the truck drivers themselves, many of whom are owner-operator businesses, OnTruck offers a steady stream of readily priced work. Its logistics platform also claims to make haulage journeys more efficient.<\/p>\n<p>Specifically, OnTruck describes its technology as automating the matching of loads to trucks, and providing real-time GPS tracking of all shipments. The company&#8217;s algorithms also attempt to dispatch work in a way that significantly cuts down on empty journeys, which is a particularly common problem for the regional and short-haul market OnTruck is targeting.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRegional trucking is where shippers and truck drivers suffer from the most inefficiency, with over 40% of kilometers driven empty,&#8221; says OnTruck CEO I\u00f1igo Juantegui. \u201cThis is where OnTruck\u2019s technology and our shipper and driver app can add the most value to lower supply chain cost for shippers and empty kilometres driven by truckers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>OnTruck clients include large multinationals such as Procter &amp; Gamble, and Decathlon, in addition to over 400 mid-sized companies in the U.K. and Spain. Juantegui says the new funding will be used to consolidate its market positions in those two countries, and to expand to more of Europe. This, I&#8217;m told, is likely to include France and Germany.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Madrid-based OnTruck, which has built a &#8220;haulage tech platform&#8221; to better match supply and demand in the road freight industry, has picked up \u20ac25 million in Series B funding.

Now, added to that, Daimler will take a seat on the Taxify board.<\/p>\n<p>Given its extensive interest in mobility, it makes sense that Daimler is backing <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/mtakso\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"mtakso\">Taxify, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> which has emerged as the main contender battling Uber in Europe and Africa, while it has also forayed into Australia, too.

OYO founder\u00a0Ritesh Agarwal is one month older, although he\u00a0did lead a unicorn at an even younger age. Still, it&#8217;s quite an achievement however you mix it.<\/p>\n<p>His original vision was to build a service for his native Estonia using money borrowed from his parents, but that vision expanded and the service is now present in over 25 countries, predominantly in Europe and Africa.\u00a0Markus Villig said today that the company has more than 500,000 drivers and over 10 million users, a big jump on the 2.5 million users it claimed back in August.\u00a0Villig added that Taxify&#8217;s ride volumes grew ten-fold last year, although he did not provide a raw figure.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1536162\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/taxify.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"382\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Taxify CEO and co-founder Markus Villig<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Markus has explained in the past that Taxify&#8217;s strategy focuses on being the second mover, most often behind <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/uber\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"uber\">Uber <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We go into markets where ride-sharing is already a proven concept&#8230; we come in and we improve on that by having just cheaper commissions and giving more back to the riders and drivers.

While tacking on more and more power to these headsets has generally been the dominating wisdom of the past five years, it&#8217;s getting to a point where the hardware that can be built has reached the good-enough stage and it&#8217;s time to bring costs down and focus on shipping units.<\/p>\n<p>To herald in this necessary step, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/qualcomm\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"qualcomm\">Qualcomm <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> announced today that it has built a dedicated chipset for standalone headsets. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.qualcomm.com\/products\/snapdragon-xr1-platform\">Snapdragon XR1<\/a> is the company&#8217;s first chipset focused exclusively on AR and VR, which the company is collectively referring to as &#8220;XR&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1647592 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/qualcomm-is-joined-onstage-by-meta-pico-odg-vive-and-vuzix.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Users will be able to enjoy experiences like streaming 4K 30fps content on XR1-powered devices.\u00a0The company had a number of headset manufacturers onstage for the announcement, including HTC Vive, Vuzix, Meta and Pico. The number of headsets being shipped today are quite small, but Qualcomm is preparing for a near future where it believes unit sales will cross into the hundreds of millions.<\/p>\n<p>Qualcomm was mostly mum on details of how this chipset performs relative to the newly-released Snapdragon 845 &#8212; which has its own VR reference design &#8212; but it seems fair to assert that the XR1 is probably a lower-cost option for hardware manufacturers that know exactly what they need and don&#8217;t want to pay to for an architecture that&#8217;s built around handling tasks that there devices won&#8217;t tackle.<\/p>\n<p>While the Snapdragon 845 is looking to push headsets towards the capabilities offered by PC-tethered systems, the XR1 is looking at low-cost devices that have a better chance at making it on shelves in the near-term. The XR1 won&#8217;t support free-moving 6DoF like the 845, but will support tighter movements like its 835 VR platform did.<\/p>\n<p>In an email responding to questions from TechCrunch, Qualcomm XR lead Hiren Bhinde said that the new chipset &#8220;will handle fewer workloads as opposed to the 845 for similar power and thermal benchmarks,&#8221; while noting that, &#8220;[t]here are also some AR customers who don\u2019t need the high graphics or memory bandwidth supported in 845 for their devices, which is what makes the XR1 a perfect fit for them.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1594655 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/odg-r8-smartglasses-ar-2.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"382\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When compared to some of today&#8217;s standalone VR headsets, many current untethered consumer AR headsets are lightweight in their compute demands because they&#8217;re not focused on replicating the world to the fidelity that VR is attempting. Headsets that simply offer a heads-up display and a voice assistant like those being shown off by Qualcomm XR1 partner Vuzix\u00a0differ from what Magic Leap and Microsoft are pursuing with their &#8220;mixed reality&#8221; devices which enable sophisticated environment mapping so that digital objects can find a natural place in a viewer&#8217;s periphery.<\/p>\n<p>By building a chipset with lower-cost mass-market headsets in their sights, Qualcomm seems convinced that the time to strike is now and that the XR1 could give manufacturers in the AR\/VR space the added boost they need to start shipping hardware.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At the end of the day, there are a lot of processes running on a smartphone-optimized chipsets that aren&#8217;t really necessary for the average virtual joe&#8217;s experience in a face computer.

in<\/a> on proposed regulation that would affect the disclosure of funding for online election ads.<\/p>\n<p>While traditional forms of media like TV and radio face strict rules for disclosing election campaign ad funding, social media and web advertising is now under similar scrutiny following revelations about Russian social media influence campaigns during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Tech companies are <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/10\/twitter-honest-ads-act\/\">warming up<\/a> to proposed regulation in Congress known as the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/bill\/115th-congress\/senate-bill\/1989\/actions\"> Honest Ads Act<\/a>, but the FEC is working on a new ruleset of its own regarding funding disclosures for election ads as well.<\/p>\n<p>In its new comments, the <a href=\"https:\/\/internetassociation.org\/\">Internet Association<\/a>\u00a0(which represents companies including Facebook, Twitter, Google, Snap and more) argued that such disclosures should be allowed to live one click away from the ads, pushing against proposals that would force disclosure to be displayed on an ad itself. The IA said such requirements would be limiting for innovation in the ad industry.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;IA also believes that technology plays an important role in providing information, and that rollovers, click-throughs, and other technology yet to be developed, can provide far more meaningful information to users than traditional \u2018in the box\u2019 disclaimers,&#8221; said IA President and CEO Michael Beckerman.<\/p>\n<p>In the filing, the IA further elaborated on its position in favor of what it calls adaptive disclaimers:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Rather than trying to fit a &#8216;paid for by&#8217; notice on an ad that may change in size when delivered on different platforms or devices, the adaptive disclaimer would be inserted into the ad and be visible and accessible in all formats.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Instead of traditional on-ad disclosures, the IA suggested a more flexible approach to implementing these regulations that would accommodate the wide range of ad types that the internet makes possible. In its comments, the IA argues that the FEC should &#8220;require internet ads to include a one-click away disclaimer or a disclaimer within the frame of the ad itself&#8221; to allow disclaimers to appear in hover-over text or in text below videos, among other less traditional ad formats.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A trade group representing big tech&#8217;s interests in Washington reached out to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) on Tuesday to weigh in on proposed regulation that would affect the disclosure of funding for online election ads.

The doorbell, then called DoorBot, has since transformed into what\u2019s now known as Ring, a security powerhouse that offers several DIY home security products and services, including the popular Ring Video Doorbell that\u2019s capable of preventing and solving neighborhood crime. Although much has changed since the company\u2019s inception, it is the mission of reducing crime in neighborhoods that continues to drive Jamie.<\/p>\n\n<p>Intensely dedicated not only to the Ring mission, but also to Ring Neighbors (what Ring calls its customers), Jamie is a loyal and trusted leader. He gives his team autonomy so that they can stay focused on what\u2019s most important: the company\u2019s mission of making neighborhoods everywhere safer.<\/p>\n\n<p>Under Jamie\u2019s direction, Ring has seen incredible success and growth. In 2018, Amazon purchased Ring,  the company\u2019s second largest acquisition. With the support of Amazon, Ring and Jamie continue to innovate and remain at the bleeding edge of home security.<\/p>\n\n<p>Prior to Ring, Jamie founded several successful ventures including PhoneTag, the world\u2019s first voicemail-to-text company, and Unsubscribe.com, a service that helped email users clean commercial email from their inboxes. He successfully sold both companies in 2009 and 2011 respectively. Jamie holds his Bachelor of Science in Entrepreneurship from Babson College. When he\u2019s not working, Jamie enjoys spending time with his wife, son, and two dogs, Shortrib and Pancake.<\/p>","cbAvatar":"https:\/\/crunchbase-production-res.cloudinary.com\/image\/upload\/wkl6omn3uxarc5xufate","company":"Ring","featured":0,"name":"James Siminoff","position":"Founder & Chief Inventor","links":{"crunchbase":"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/james-siminoff","twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JamieSiminoff","linkedin":"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/jamessiminoff"}},{"bio":"<p>John Riccitiello was appointed Chairman and CEO of Unity Technologies in October 2014.
