# css-optimizer
[css-optimizer](https://github.com/thoqbk/css-optimizer) is a tool that helps you to remove `un-used css rules` (`extra css rules`) basing on sample html files of your website

## Usage

```java
//Step 01.
//Initialize CSSOptimizer with target css file (file will be optimized) 
//and output file (result file after optimizing target cssfile)
CSSOptimizer optimizer = new CSSOptimizer("bootstrap.css","bootstrap.min.css");

//Step 02. Sampling your website by downloading web pages or using http urls
optimizer.addHtmlFile("about-us.htm");
optimizer.addHtmlFile("home.htm");
optimizer.addHtmlFile("blog.htm");
optimizer.addHtmlFile("http://your-website.com/product/ipad");

//Step 03. Some classes or tags are added using Javascript code, declare them here:
optimizer.keepClassName("img-thumbnail");
optimizer.keepClassName("pagination");
optimizer.keepTagName("hr");
        
//Step 04. Execute optimizing, 
//result file will be stored in path that is declared in Step 01.
optimizer.optimize();
```

## Example

We used [css-optimizer](https://github.com/thoqbk/css-optimizer) to remove `un-used css rules` in library [bootstrap.css](http://getbootstrap.com/css/). 

As the result, `59%` rule has been removed, css file size reduced from `121KB` to `59KB` 
and increased about `5 score` when testing my site on [Google PageSpeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)

Please check out and run the test file [TestCSSOptimizer.java](https://github.com/thoqbk/css-optimizer/blob/master/src/test/java/com/megaads/css/optimizer/test/TestCSSOptimizer.java) to see example result

## Solution and design
The most important things that i use in this project are `Regular Expression` and [CSS Rule design](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSRule). I use `Regular Expression` to split css rules and extract all information about rules and put them into object models (CSSStyleRule, NonCSSStyleRule and CSSMediaRule). Following is `class diagram` of [css-optimizer](https://github.com/thoqbk/css-optimizer):

Steps to optimize css file includes:
* Step 1. use [jsoup](http://jsoup.org/) to parse sampling html files and extract all used html tags and css classes
* Step 2. use `Regular Expression` to parse css file and put information into object models
* Step 3. compare the result from `Step 1.` and `Step 2.` to get only used css rules and write down them into the result file
